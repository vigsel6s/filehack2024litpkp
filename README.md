## About the Competition

The File Hack 2024 competition is a yearly event hosted by LIT PKP, where participants are challenged to create innovative solutions for file management and organization. This year's theme is "Simplifying the Chaos", and we are excited to present our submission for the competition.

## Our Project

Our project is a revolutionary file management system that utilizes LIT PKP technology to simplify the chaos of organizing and accessing files. With our user-friendly interface and advanced algorithms, users can easily search, categorize, and share files with just a few clicks.

## How to Use
